The **ConnectyCube Chat API** is a set of tools that enables developers to integrate real-time messaging into their web and mobile applications. With this API, users can build powerful chat functionalities that support one-on-one messaging, group chats, typing indicators, message history, delivery receipts, and push notifications.
  
If you’re planning to build a new app, we recommend starting with one of our [code samples apps](/reactnative/getting-started/code-samples) as a foundation for your client app.    
If you already have an app and you are looking to add a chat to it, proceed with this guide. This guide walks you through installing the ConnectyCube SDK in your app, configure it and then sending your first message to the opponent in 1-1 chat.

## Before you start

Before you start, make sure:
1. You have access to your ConnectyCube account. If you don’t have an account, [sign up here](https://admin.connectycube.com/register).
2. An app created in ConnectyCube dashboard. Once logged into [your ConnectyCube account](https://admin.connectycube.com), create a new application and make a note of the app credentials (app ID and auth key) that you’ll need for authentication.

## Step 1: Configure SDK

To use chat in a client app, you should install, import and configure ConnectyCube SDK.

<div style={{
  fontSize: "0.9em",
  color: "#666",
  backgroundColor: "#f0f4ff",
  borderLeft: "4px solid #ccc",
  paddingLeft: "10px",
  marginTop: "10px"
}}>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If the app is already created during the onboarding process and you followed all the instructions, you can skip the 'Configure SDK' step and start with <a href="#step-2-create-and-authorise-user">Create and Authorise User</a>.
</div>

### Install SDK

Install package from the command line:

<Tabs syncKey="installSDK">
<TabItem label='npm'>
```bash
npm install --save react-native-connectycube
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='yarn'>
```bash
yarn add react-native-connectycube
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Import SDK

Add the following import statement to start using all classes and methods.

```javascript
import ConnectyCube from 'react-native-connectycube';
```

### Initialize SDK

Initialize the SDK with your ConnectyCube application credentials. You can access your application credentials in [ConnectyCube Dashboard](https://admin.connectycube.com):

<Tabs syncKey="codeExamples">
<TabItem label='SDK v4'>
```javascript
const CREDENTIALS = {
  appId: 21,
  authKey: 'hhf87hfushuiwef',
};

ConnectyCube.init(CREDENTIALS);
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label='SDK v3'>
```javascript
const CREDENTIALS = {
  appId: 21,
  authKey: 'hhf87hfushuiwef',
  authSecret: 'jjsdf898hfsdfk',
};

ConnectyCube.init(CREDENTIALS);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create and Authorise User

As a starting point, the user's session token needs to be created allowing to send and receive messages in chat.    

```javascript
const userCredentials = { login: "cubeuser", password: "awesomepwd" };
// const userCredentials = { email: 'cubeuser@gmail.com', password: 'awesomepwd' };
// const userCredentials = { provider: 'facebook', keys: {token: 'a876as7db...asg34dasd8wqe'} };

ConnectyCube.createSession(userCredentials)
  .then((session) => {})
  .catch((error) => {});
```

**Note:** With the request above, __the user is created automatically on the fly upon session creation__ using the login (or email) and password from the request parameters.

<div style={{
  fontSize: "0.75em",
  color: "#666",
  backgroundColor: "#f0f4ff",
  borderLeft: "4px solid #ccc",
  paddingLeft: "10px",
  marginTop: "20px"
}}>

  <strong>Important:</strong> such approach with the automatic user creation works well for testing purposes and while the application isn’t launched on production. For better security it is recommended to deny the session creation without an existing user.    
  For this, set ‘Session creation without an existing user entity’ to **Deny** under the **Application -> Overview -> Permissions** in the [admin panel](https://admin.connectycube.com/apps). 
</div>


## Step 3: Connect User to chat

Connecting to the chat is an essential step in enabling real-time communication. By establishing a connection, the user is authenticated on the chat server, allowing them to send and receive messages instantly. Without this connection, the app won't be able to interact with other users in the chat.

```javascript
const userCredentials = {
  userId: 4448514,
  password: "supersecurepwd",
};

ConnectyCube.chat
  .connect(userCredentials)
  .then(() => {
    // connected
  })
  .catch((error) => {});
```

## Step 4: Create 1-1 chat

Creating a 1-1 chat gives a unique conversation ID to correctly route and organize your message to the intended user.

You need to pass `type: 3` (1-1 chat) and an **ID** of an opponent you want to create a chat with:

```javascript
const params = {
  type: 3,
  occupants_ids: [56],
};

ConnectyCube.chat.dialog
  .create(params)
  .then((dialog) => {})
  .catch((error) => {});
```

## Step 5: Send / Receive chat messages

Once the 1-1 chat is set up, you can use it to exchange messages seamlessly. This code example demonstrates how to send and receive messages in the created 1-1 chat:

```javascript
const dialog = ...;
const opponentId = 56;
const message = {
  type: dialog.type === 3 ? 'chat' : 'groupchat',
  body: "How are you today?",
  extension: {
    save_to_history: 1,
    dialog_id: dialog._id
  }
};

message.id = ConnectyCube.chat.send(opponentId, message);

// ...

ConnectyCube.chat.onMessageListener = onMessage;

function onMessage(userId, message) {
    console.log('[ConnectyCube.chat.onMessageListener] callback:', userId, message)
}
```

That's it! You've mastered the basics of sending a chat message in ConnectyCube.
