Welcome to ConnectyCube - messaging and voice/video calling platform for Flutter, React Native, Web, Native Script, Cordova, iOS and Android platforms.

Here we are going to explain how to get started with ConnectyCube by following simple steps:

- Register a free ConnectyCube account and create your first Application there to obtain credentials.
- Download SDK for your platform.
- Connect SDK with your Application.

## Register a ConnectyCube account

Go to [https://connectycube.com/signup/](https://connectycube.com/signup/) and register a ConnectyCube account.

You will receive a confirmation e-mail shortly. Confirm your registration by following the link in the e-mail.

## Sign in to the Dashboard

Go to [https://admin.connectycube.com/signin](https://admin.connectycube.com/signin), enter your Login and Password and click on the **Log in** button.

## Create 1st application

Upon sign in you will see the main page where you need to find the **New app** button and click on it.

Next step is to fill the **Add new application** form. Here you need to enter the information such as the title of your app, its website, type and description.

> **Note**: Fields **Title** and **Type** are mandatory, others are optional.

Click on the button **Add** in the bottom. The app will appear in the list of your apps.

Click on app title to view its credentials.

You will see the auto-generated values of the **Application ID**, **Authorization key** and **Authorization secret**. These are important - your app needs to use these credentials so that server knows who's there.
