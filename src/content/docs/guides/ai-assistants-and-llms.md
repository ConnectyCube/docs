- [llms-full.txt](https://developers.connectycube.com/llms-full.txt) - the complete documentation, including all pages and sections.
- **Markdown version of any page** - view the Markdown source of any documentation page by appending `/index.html.md` to its URL For example, the plain text content of the current page is available at [https://developers.connectycube.com/guides/ai-assistants-and-llms/index.html.md](https://developers.connectycube.com/guides/ai-assistants-and-llms/index.html.md).
