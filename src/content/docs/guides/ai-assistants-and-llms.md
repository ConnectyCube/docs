## AI Assistant in Documentation

Coming soon

## Plain Text Documentation

The ConnectyCube documentation is available in plain text format, which allows LLMs and AI tools to easily parse and understand the content.

You can access the following plain text documentation files:

- [llms.txt](https://developers.connectycube.com/llms.txt) - contains a short structure of links to important documentation pages.
- [llms-small.txt](https://developers.connectycube.com/llms-small.txt) - a compact version of the documentation for ConnectyCube, with non-essential content removed.
- [llms-full.txt](https://developers.connectycube.com/llms-full.txt) - contains the full documentation content, including all pages and sections.
- **Markdown version of any page** - You can access the Markdown version of any documentation page by appending `/index.html.md` to the page URL. For example, the plain text content of the current page is available at [https://developers.connectycube.com/guides/ai-assistants-and-llms/index.html.md](https://developers.connectycube.com/guides/ai-assistants-and-llms/index.html.md).

You can provide these files to your AI tools or LLM editors like [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs). This will help them understand the ConnectyCube documentation and provide better assistance when building customizations or answering questions.
