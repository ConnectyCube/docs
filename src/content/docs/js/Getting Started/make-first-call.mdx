**ConnectyCube Video Calling Peer-to-Peer (P2P) API** provides a solution for integrating real-time video and audio calling into your application. This API enables you to create smooth one-on-one and group video calls, supporting a wide range of use cases like virtual meetings, telemedicine consultations, social interactions, and more. The P2P approach ensures that media streams are transferred directly between users whenever possible, minimizing latency and delivering high-quality audio and video. 

If you’re planning to build a new app, we recommend starting with one of our [code samples apps](/js/getting-started/code-samples) as a foundation for your client app.    
If you already have an app and you are looking to add chat and voice/video calls to it, proceed with this guide. This guide walks you through installing the ConnectyCube SDK in your app, configure it and then initiating the call to the opponent.

## Before you start

Before you start, make sure:
1. You have access to ConnectyCube account. If you don’t have an account, [sign up here](https://admin.connectycube.com/register).
2. An app created in ConnectyCube dashboard. Once logged into [your ConnectyCube account](https://admin.connectycube.com/signin), create a new application and make a note of the app credentials (app ID and auth key) that you’ll need for authentication.

## Step 1: Configure SDK

To use chat in a client app, you should install, import and configure ConnectyCube SDK.

<div style={{
  fontSize: "0.9em",
  color: "#666",
  backgroundColor: "#f0f4ff",
  borderLeft: "4px solid #ccc",
  paddingLeft: "10px",
  marginTop: "10px"
}}>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If the app is already created during the onboarding process and you followed all the instructions, you can skip the 'Configure SDK' step and start with <a href="#step-2-create-and-authorise-user">Create and Authorise User</a>.
</div>


### Install SDK

#### React, Angular, Vue etc.

Install package from the command line:

<Tabs syncKey="installSDK">
<TabItem label='npm'>
```bash
npm install --save connectycube
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='yarn'>
```bash
yarn add connectycube
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Plain HTML

Сonnect SDK js file as a normal script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/connectycube/dist/connectycube.min.js"></script>
```

#### Vite

If you use [Vite](https://vite.dev/) build tool, update `vite.config.ts` and add the following:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: ...
  esbuild: ...

  define: {
    // add this line for ConnectyCube to work properly
    global: {},
  },
})
```

Also, it needs to add polyfils for some node libs.

Install the package as a dev dependency:

<Tabs syncKey="installVitePolyfills">
<TabItem label='npm'>
```bash
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-node-polyfills
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='yarn'>
```bash
yarn add --dev vite-plugin-node-polyfills
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Add the plugin to your **vite.config.ts** file:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { nodePolyfills } from 'vite-plugin-node-polyfills'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    nodePolyfills(),
  ],
})
```

For Vite 6 to work, add the following code in **package.json**:

```json
"overrides": {
  "vite-plugin-node-polyfills": {
    "vite": "^6.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Remix SSR (Server-Side Rendering) guide

When using the ConnectyCube SDK in SSR environments like Remix, native Node.js modules such as "events" may cause runtime errors due to differences between Node and browser environments.  
To ensure smooth SSR integration, follow the steps below.

Install ConnectyCube SDK and apply SSR patches:

<Tabs syncKey="installConnectyCubeSSR">
<TabItem label='npm'>
```bash
npm install --save connectycube
npx connectycube patch-ssr      # apply SSR patches
# npx connectycube revert-ssr   # revert SSR patches (if needed)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='yarn'>
```bash
yarn add connectycube
yarn connectycube patch-ssr     # apply SSR patches
# yarn connectycube revert-ssr  # revert SSR patches (if needed)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Remix Config Update

Add the following option in your **remix.config.js** or **remix.config.ts** file to polyfill the "events" module, which is required by ConnectyCube's dependencies:

```javascript
/**
 * @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig}
 */
const commonConfig = {
  // ... your existing config options ...
  browserNodeBuiltinsPolyfill: {
    modules: {
      events: true,
    },
  },
};

export default remixConfig;
```

This enables polyfilling of the Node.js "events" module in the browser environment, preventing errors related to "@xmpp/events" and similar packages used internally by ConnectyCube SDK.

### Import SDK

Add the following import statement to start using all classes and methods.

```javascript
import ConnectyCube from 'connectycube';
```

**this is not needed for Plain HTML*

### Initialize SDK

Initialize framework with your ConnectyCube application credentials. You can access your application credentials in [ConnectyCube Dashboard](https://admin.connectycube.com):

<Tabs syncKey="codeExamples">
<TabItem label='SDK v4'>
```javascript
const CREDENTIALS = {
  appId: 21,
  authKey: "hhf87hfushuiwef",
};

ConnectyCube.init(CREDENTIALS);
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label='SDK v3'>
```javascript
const CREDENTIALS = {
  appId: 21,
  authKey: "hhf87hfushuiwef",
  authSecret: "jjsdf898hfsdfk",
};

ConnectyCube.init(CREDENTIALS);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Step 2: Create and Authorise User

As a starting point, the user's session token needs to be created allowing to participate in calls.    

```javascript
const userCredentials = { login: "marvin18", password: "supersecurepwd" };

ConnectyCube.createSession(userCredentials)
  .then((session) => {})
  .catch((error) => {});
```

**Note:** With the request above, __the user is created automatically on the fly upon session creation__ using the login (or email) and password from the request parameters.

<div style={{
  fontSize: "0.75em",
  color: "#666",
  backgroundColor: "#f0f4ff",
  borderLeft: "4px solid #ccc",
  paddingLeft: "10px",
  marginTop: "20px"
}}>

  <strong>Important:</strong> such approach with the automatic user creation works well for testing purposes and while the application isn’t launched on production. For better security it is recommended to deny the session creation without an existing user.    
  For this, set ‘Session creation without an existing user entity’ to **Deny** under the **Application -> Overview -> Permissions** in the [admin panel](https://admin.connectycube.com/apps). 
</div>

## Step 3: Connect User to chat

Connecting to the chat is an essential step in enabling real-time communication.

To start using Video Calling API you need to connect user to Chat as ConnectyCube Chat API is used as a signalling transport for Video Calling API:

```javascript
const userCredentials = {
  userId: 4448514,
  password: "supersecurepwd",
};

ConnectyCube.chat
  .connect(userCredentials)
  .then(() => {
    // connected
  })
  .catch((error) => {});
```

## Step 4: Create video session

In order to use Video Calling API you need to create a call session object - choose your opponents with whom you will have a call and a type of session (VIDEO or AUDIO).

> **Note**
>
> The calleesIds array must contain the opponents ids only and exclude current user id.

```javascript
const calleesIds = [56, 76, 34]; // User's ids
const sessionType = ConnectyCube.videochat.CallType.VIDEO; // AUDIO is also possible
const additionalOptions = {};
const session = ConnectyCube.videochat.createNewSession(calleesIds, sessionType, additionalOptions);
```

## Step 5: Access local media stream

In order to have a video chat session you need to get an access to the user’s devices (webcam / microphone):

```javascript
const mediaParams = {
  audio: true,
  video: true
};

session
  .getUserMedia(mediaParams)
  .then((localStream) => {
    // display local stream
    session.attachMediaStream("myVideoElementId", localStream, {
      muted: true,
      mirror: true,
    });
  })
  .catch((error) => {});
```

This method lets the browser ask the user for permission to use devices. You should allow this dialog to access the stream. Otherwise, the browser can’t obtain access and will throw an error for `getUserMedia` callback function.

## Step 6: Initiate a call

Use the code below to initiate call with the opponent(s):

```javascript
const extension = {};
session.call(extension, (error) => {});
```

The extension is used to pass any extra parameters in the request to your opponents.

After this, your opponents will receive a callback call:

```javascript
ConnectyCube.videochat.onCallListener = function (session, extension) {};
```

Or if your opponents are offline or did not answer the call request:

```javascript
ConnectyCube.videochat.onUserNotAnswerListener = function (session, userId) {};
```

## Step 7: Accept a call

To accept a call the following code snippet is used:

```javascript
ConnectyCube.videochat.onCallListener = function (session, extension) {
  // Here we need to show a dialog with 2 buttons - Accept & Reject.
  // By accepting -> run the following code:
  //
  // 1. await session.getUserMedia (...)
  //
  // 2. Accept call request:
  const extension = {};
  session.accept(extension);
};
```

After this, you will get a confirmation in the following callback:

```javascript
ConnectyCube.videochat.onAcceptCallListener = function (session, userId, extension) {};
```

Also, both the caller and opponents will get a special callback with the remote stream:

```javascript
ConnectyCube.videochat.onRemoteStreamListener = function (session, userID, remoteStream) {
  // attach the remote stream to DOM element
  session.attachMediaStream("remoteOpponentVideoElementId", remoteStream);
};
```

Great work! You've completed the essentials of making a call in ConnectyCube. From this point, you and your opponents should start seeing each other.
